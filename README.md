# ThirdEye: Advanced Driver Safety System with Facial Monitoring and Automatic Braking


The "ThirdEye: Advanced Driver Safety System with Facial Monitoring and Automatic Braking" project introduces a pioneering driver safety system designed to mitigate accidents resulting from driver drowsiness or fatigue. Leveraging an advanced camera module discreetly integrated into the vehicle's dashboard and powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, this system employs sophisticated Python libraries—cv2, numpy, dlib, imutils, and face_utils—for real-time facial monitoring and recognition.

## Features

- **Real-Time Facial Monitoring:** Utilizes advanced camera modules and Python libraries to detect driver drowsiness.
- **Immediate Alarm Response:** Activates an alarm within 2 seconds of detecting closed eyes or signs of fatigue to alert the driver.
- **Autonomous Braking Mechanism:** Engages automatic braking if the driver remains unresponsive for 5 seconds, preventing potential accidents.
- **Integrated Hardware and Software:** Combines Arduino Uno with facial monitoring technologies for seamless operation.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno, advanced camera module.
- **Programming Languages:** Python.
- **Libraries:** cv2, numpy, dlib, imutils, face_utils.

## How It Works

1. **Facial Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the driver's facial expressions using the camera module and Python libraries.
2. **Drowsiness Detection:** Detects signs of drowsiness, such as closed eyes, using real-time image processing.
3. **Alarm Activation:** Sounds an alarm within 2 seconds to alert the driver.
4. **Automatic Braking:** Engages the braking mechanism if the driver remains unresponsive for 5 seconds.
